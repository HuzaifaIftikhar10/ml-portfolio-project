## Project Scope

### Goals
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail a final exam based on their study habits and academic history. This model can help educators identify students who may need additional support.

### Data
The dataset will be stored in `data/student_performance.csv`. It will include the following features:
- `study_hours`: Average daily study time
- `attendance_rate`: Class attendance percentage
- `previous_score`: Score from the last exam
- `pass`: Target variable indicating whether the student passed (Yes/No)

The dataset will be synthetic (created for learning purposes).

### Analysis
The analysis will include the following steps:
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Visualize important trends
4. Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest)
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall
